Hi, I’m Ali Talpur. I currently work on the Platform Team @[Coalition Inc.](https://coalitioninc.com) Cyber risk and security have recently piqued my interest and it’s an exciting time to be in a field with tremendous growth and opportunities.

Looking back on my life, my passion for technology started at an early age. I took apart TVs and video game systems to figure out how they worked underneath the hood. Luckily for me, my parents didn't mind. Later, during my teenage years, I found my love for Linux while I was bored during one summer vacation. An unexpected YouTube video showed me the difference between Linux and Windows while I was trying to fix my parents' Windows computer at the time. As I learned more about how operating systems work, I became more curious and successfully brute-forced my wifi.

Eventually, my interest in tech led me to graduate from [UCSD](https://ucsd.edu/) and work as a software engineer (SWE) at Intuit. Earlier in my career, I worked on backend APIs as an SWE and later transitioned into the SRE space to build out distributed systems at scale. My interest was inspired by my company at the time, which was looking to move from its internal data centers to utilize AWS. I remember having to wait 4 days to get a server one time and it wasn’t correctly configured. I figured I wanted to learn more about infrastructure so I can eliminate the toil. That put me on the path I’m currently on. Overall, I’ve enjoyed working both as an SRE and SWE.

Outside of tech, I enjoy playing soccer, tennis and basketball, hanging out with my family, and playing video games.
