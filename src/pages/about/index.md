Hi, I’m Ali Talpur. I’m currently working on the Platform Team @ [Coalition Inc.](https://coalitioninc.com) Cyber risk and security have piqued my interest recently and it’s an exciting time to be in a field with tremendous growth and opportunities.

Looking back on my life my passion for technology started at an early age when I took apart TVs, and video game systems to figure out how they worked underneath the hood luckily for me my parents didn’t mind. Later, in my teenage years, I found my love for Linux while just being bored during one summer vacation. An unexpected youtube video showed me the difference between Linux and windows while I was trying to fix my parent's windows computer at the time. While learning more about how operating systems work, I became more curious and successfully brute-forced my wifi.

Eventually, my interest in tech led me to graduate from [UCSD](https://ucsd.edu/) and work as an SWE at Intuit. Earlier, in my career, I worked on backend APIs as an SWE and later transitioned into the SRE space to build out distributed systems at scale. My interest was inspired by my company at the time looking to move from its internal data centers to utilize AWS. I remember having to wait 4 days to get a server one time and it wasn’t correctly configured and figured I wanted to learn more about infrastructure so I don’t have to deal with this anymore. That put me on the path I’m currently in overall I’ve enjoyed working both as an SRE and SWE.

Outside of tech, I enjoy playing tennis, and basketball, hanging out with my family, and playing video games.
