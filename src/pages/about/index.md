Hi, I'm Ali Talpur. I'm currently working on the Platform Team @ [Coalition Inc](https://coalitioninc.com). Cyberrisk and security have piqued my interest recently and it's an exciting time to be in a field with tremendous growth and opportunites.

Looking back on my life my passion for technology started at an early age where I took apart TVs, and gaming systems to figure out how they worked underneath the hood luckily for me my parents didn't mind. Later, in my teenage years I found my love for linux while just being bored one summer vacation. A random youtube algorithm video showed me the difference between linux and windows while I was trying to fix my windows computer at the time. While learning more about how operating systems work and the different types of operating systems I got more and more curious and sucessfully brute forced my own wifi.

Eventually, my interest in tech lead me to graduate from [UCSD](https://ucsd.edu/) and work as a SWE at Intuit. Earlier, in my career I worked on backend APIs as a SWE and later transitioned into the SRE space to build out distrubited systems at scale. My interest was inspired by my company at the time looking to move from their internal datacenters to utilize AWS. I remeber having to wait 4 days to get a server one time and it wasn't correctly configured and figured I wanted to learn more about infrastracture so I don't have to deal with this anymore. That put me on the path I'm currently in overall I've enjoyed working both as a SRE and SWE.

Outside of tech, I enjoy playing tennis, basketball, hangout with my family and play video games.
