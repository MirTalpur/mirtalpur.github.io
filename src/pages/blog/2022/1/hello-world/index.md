Hello world! I'll be utilizing this site for my thoughts what you can find here are mostly topics that pique my interests.

Some of my interests include finance, tech, cybersecurity, gaming, travel and more. Here’s a bit more [about me](https://mirtalpur.github.io/about).

Most days I spend my time working on platforms, distributed systems, developer productivity, building services(APIs), IAC (Infrastracture as Code), and k8s.

At night I usually like to work on side [projects/products](https://mirtalpur.github.io/projects) or I try to read tech books, and books in general. I also have
nights where I game the night away.
