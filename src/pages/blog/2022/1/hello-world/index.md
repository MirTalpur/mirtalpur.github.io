Hello, World! I'll be using this space to share my thoughts on a variety of topics that interest me, including finance, technology, cybersecurity, gaming, travel, and more. If you're curious about who I am, you can find more information about me on my [about page](https://mirtalpur.github.io/about)..

During the day, I spend most of my time working on platforms, distributed systems, developer productivity, building services (APIs), Infrastructure as Code (IAC), and Kubernetes. At night, I like to work on side projects/products or read technical and non-technical books. I also enjoy gaming in my free time.

The main motivation behind this blog is to hold myself accountable for the initiatives I'm undertaking, share my thoughts and ideas, and possibly help individuals who are facing similar challenges in their careers.
