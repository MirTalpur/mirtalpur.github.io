Hello, world! I'll be utilizing this site for my thoughts what you can find here are mostly topics that pique my interests.

Some of my interests include finance, tech, cybersecurity, gaming, travel, and more. Hereâ€™s a bit more [about me](https://mirtalpur.github.io/about).

Most days I spend my time working on platforms, distributed systems, developer productivity, building services(APIs), IAC (Infrastructure as Code), and k8s.

At night I usually like to work on side [projects/products](https://mirtalpur.github.io/projects) or I try to read tech books, and books in general. I also have
nights where I game the night away.

My motivation behind this site is to have some external accountability for initiatives I'm undertaking, have a place to share my thoughts/ideas, and possibly help individuals running into similar issues in their careers.
